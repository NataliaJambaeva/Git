# Git

Git makes branching and merging operations easy and efficient. You can create branches to work on new features or experiments, and later merge them back into the main branch.

Git supports remote repositories, which enable collaboration among multiple developers. You can push your local changes to a remote repository, pull changes made by others, and resolve conflicts that may arise during the process.
